# Chemistry Textbook Downloader

This short Python script downloads every page of the [Cambridge IGCSE Chemistry Third Edition textbook](https://online.anyflip.com/kqdza/crea/mobile/) and combines them into a PDF. The motivation for writing this script is that the website requires you to create an account to download the PDF, which I don't want to do. In hindsight, that might have been more convenient to do than writing and running this script.

## Usage

```
$ pip install grequests pillow  # If you haven't done so
$ python3 main.py
```

This might take a minute to run.
